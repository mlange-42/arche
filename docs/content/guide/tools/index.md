A number of tools has been created for Arche.

If you wrote a tool and want it to be included here, please [open an issue](https://github.com/mlange-42/arche/issues/new) on GitHub.


* [arche-serde](https://github.com/mlange-42/arche-serde) provides JSON serialization and deserialization for *Arche*'s World.

* [arche-model](https://github.com/mlange-42/arche-model) provides a wrapper around *Arche*, and some common systems and resources.
its purpose is to get started with prototyping and developing simulation models immediately, focussing on the model logic.

* [arche-pixel](https://github.com/mlange-42/arche-pixel) provides OpenGL graphics and live plots for *Arche* using the [Pixel](https://github.com/gopxl/pixel) game engine.

* [arche-demo](https://github.com/mlange-42/arche-demo) provides examples of Arche models, which can be viewed in a [live demo](https://mlange-42.github.io/arche-demo/).
