The *World* ({{< api ecs World >}}) is the central data storage in Arche.
It manages and stores entities ({{< api ecs Entity >}}), their components, as well as [Resources](../resources).
For the internal structure of the world, see chapter [Architecture](../../background/architecture).

Here, we only deal with world creation.
Most world functionality is covered in chapters [Entities & Components](../entities) and [World Entity Access](../world-access).

## World creation

To create a world with default settings, use {{< api ecs NewWorld >}}:

{{< code-func world_test.go TestWorldSimple >}}

A world can also be configured with an initial capacity:

{{< code-func world_test.go TestWorldConfig >}}

The initial capacity is used to initialize archetypes, the entity list, etc.

For archetypes with an [Entity Relation](../relations), a separate initial capacity can be specified:

{{< code-func world_test.go TestWorldConfigRelations >}}

## Reset the world

For systematic simulations, it is possible to reset a populated world for reuse:

{{< code-func world_test.go TestWorldReset >}}
