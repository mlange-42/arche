// EntityEvent contains information about ECS operations like component and relation changes to an [Entity].
//
// To receive change events, register a [Listener] with [World.SetListener].
//
// # Event types & subscriptions
//
// Events notified are entity creation and removal, component addition and removal,
// and change of relations and their targets.
//
// Event types that are subscribed are determined by [Listener].Subscriptions.
// Events that cover multiple types (e.g. entity creation and component addition) are only notified once.
// Field EventTypes contains the [event.Subscription] bits of covered event types.
//
// See sub-package [event] and the [event.Subscription] constants for event types and subscription logic.
//
// # Event scheduling
//
// Events are emitted immediately after the change is applied.
//
// Except for removed entities, events are always fired when the [World] is in an unlocked state.
// Events for removed entities are fired right before removal of the entity,
// to allow for inspection of it's components.
// Therefore, the [World] is in a locked state during entity removal events.
//
// Events for batch-creation of entities using a [Builder] are fired after all entities are created.
// For batch methods that return a [Query], events are fired after the [Query] is closed (or fully iterated).
// This allows the [World] to be in an unlocked state, and notifies after potential entity initialization.
