// Package relations benchmarks different ways to create entity relations:
//   - Children know their parent entity
//   - Parents have an array of child entities
//   - Parents have a slice of child entities
//   - Children form an implicit linked lists, parents know the first child
//
// The task is to sum up a value over all children of each parent.
//
// The benchmarks are implemented in a way that only one components needs to be fetched for each parent and each child.
//
// Each parent has 10 children. Benchmarks are run for 100, 1000 and 10k and 100k parent entities.
